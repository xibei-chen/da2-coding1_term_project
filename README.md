# Explore Racial Disparities at Police Stopes in th US
This is a project for my studies. The aim of the project is to find patterns of association between probability to get searched at police stops and subject's race and other explanatory variables subject's sex and age and officer's race and sex, and their interactions. The sample used for this analysis is police stops in Louisville from 2015 January to 2018 January. 

## Conclusion
In general, unsurprisingly when controlling on driver's gender, officer's gender and race, black drivers are expected to be around 3% more likely to get searched than white drivers on average. What's new for me is, we expect the disadvantage for black drivers regarding probability of getting searched to be lower when the driver is female instead of male and when officer is non-white instead of white, whereas driver's age and officer's gender have no statistically significant effect on the matter. Last but not least, within the US, it is assumed that the external validity of the preferred regression model to be quite high, we might expect similar slope coefficient for driver's race for other regions in the US.
